# COVID19-India
Trying to analyse and predict the number of people affected by coronavirus COVID-19, specifically in India. 

Coronavirus, COVID-19, has taken a toll on most of us. Hence, I have made this repository to make data accessible to everyone to help analyse, predict and control the spread of the virus. I have compiled various data: Population, Hospitals, Police Officials, Gender Ratio, etc.

India has been affected by the whole situation pretty late. The number of cases in India started increasing by mid-march and it has been increasing exponentially. Because of the widespread shortage of testing, the data is necessarily limited in the picture it presents of the outbreak.

I intend to publish regular updates to the code in this repository.
